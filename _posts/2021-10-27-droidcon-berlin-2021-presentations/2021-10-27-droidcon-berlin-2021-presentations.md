I‚Äôve had a fantastic week at [#dcbln21](https://twitter.com/hashtag/dcbln21?src=hashtag_click). I couldn‚Äôt ask for a better event for us to be once again together. I‚Äôve had the opportunity to meet numerous people in person and remember how good it feels to talk to a live audience.

Now that I‚Äôm back to reality, I wanted to check a couple of slides from talks that I‚Äôve watched and as I was bookmarking them, I‚Äôve decided to go that extra mile and try to gather them in a single post.

**Note:** if you‚Äôve found slides that are not here, please add them in the comments, that I‚Äôll update this post.
