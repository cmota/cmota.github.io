Iâ€™ve recently noticed that using android tools like the adb or the emulator directly from the terminal werenâ€™t as common as I thought it would be.

It can be a bit tricky at first to configure but aftward youâ€™ll see that itâ€™s really handy for development.
1. Launch the Terminal app
2. Open the bash_profile
    ```shell
nano ~/.bash_profile
    ```
3. Add your Android SDK path:
    ```shell
export ANDROID_SDK_ROOT=/Users/${whois}/Library/Android/sdk
export PATH=$ANDROID_SDK_ROOT/emulator:$ANDROID_SDK_ROOT/tools:$PATH
    ```
4. Press ctrl+x followed by y and enter to save your changes.

Thatâ€™s it, youâ€™re all set! ðŸ™Œ


Oh, and you donâ€™t need to launch the Terminal app you can use the one thatâ€™s already built-in Android Studio:

Now feel free to try out some of the most common adb commands:

Or using the emulator:

```shell
emulator -list-avds
emulator @<your_emulator_name> -dns-server 8.8.8.8
```
