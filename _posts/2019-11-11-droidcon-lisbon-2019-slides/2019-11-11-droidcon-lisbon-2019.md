This year I had the opportunity on both attending and speak at Droidcon Lisbon, in Portugal. It was an amazing first edition filled with amazing speakers and friends from throughout the country.

Recently I was searching for the slides of one of the talks and noticed that there was no global repository with them all, so well â€” now there is ðŸ™ŒðŸ™‚.
