After receiving really good feedback about my previous post about the slides of [Droidcon Lisbon](https://medium.com/@cafonsomota/droidcon-lisbon-2019-slides-fdde0ae8aaa7) â€” Iâ€™ve decided to do the same for Droidcon Greece ðŸ™‚.

Iâ€™ve had an amazing experience at Heraklion! Droidcon Greece was part of a week-long festival â€” singularity, which was the home of different tech events: DevFest, Kotlin/Everywhere, Flutter Exp, etc. (special congratulations to the team that managed to put everything together, nicely done!). Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to meet new people and revisited old friends that didnâ€™t waste any time to show me the potential of Raki ðŸ™Œ.

Really good memories! But, Iâ€™m here to gather all the slides from the conference â€” so you can find them below.
