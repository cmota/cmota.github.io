# Gettingâ€¦ your BottomSheetScaffold working on Jetpack Compose Beta 03

Gettingâ€¦ your BottomSheetScaffold working on Jetpack Compose Beta 03 cover image

Itâ€™s Monday, no releases this week, andâ€¦ thereâ€™s a new version of Jetpack Compose â€” beta 03â€”available. What a perfect time to just increment 02 to 03 and see whatâ€™s new.

The API is (almost) final so after updating from alpha to beta there werenâ€™t any big changes to do. However, and remember thatâ€™s still in development, thereâ€™s always something that I need to update. Sometimes the behavior changes, other times I wasn't doing things right, like this one.

## BottomSheetScaffold

The `BottomSheetScaffold` allows you to show a bottom sheet in your app quite easily. You just need to define

```kotlin
val bottomSheetScaffoldState = rememberBottomSheetScaffoldState(
    bottomSheetState = rememberBottomSheetState(
        initialValue = BottomSheetValue.Collapsed
    )
)
    
BottomSheetScaffold(
    sheetContent = {
        // The content you want to show in your bottom sheet
    },
    scaffoldState = bottomSheetScaffoldState) {
        // The content you want to show in your screen*
    }
)
```
And when you want to show it just call:
```kotlin
bottomSheetScaffoldState.bottomSheetState.expand()
```

or to hide it:
```kotlin
bottomSheetScaffoldState.bottomSheetState.collapse()
```

### Updating to beta01â€“02

When **beta 01** was launched you could no longer call:

```kotlin
bottomSheetScaffoldState.bottomSheetState.expand()
```

directly without being in a coroutine. Otherwise, the project wonâ€™t even compile and you would see the error:
> Suspend function â€˜collapseâ€™ should be called only from a coroutine or another suspend function

Also, along with this release, you no longer had the possibility to set a callback in the expand function that would be executed after the animation has ended.

At the time I noticed that the solution for this was quite easy, I just needed to call the expand() or collapse() inside of a coroutine, and after looking online the approach that most people were following was:

```kotlin
GlobalScope.launch {
    bottomSheetScaffoldState.bottomSheetState.collapse()
}
```

After making this change everything was working fine and I didnâ€™t think twice about this solutionâ€¦ well, until beta 03.

### Updating to beta03

Now after updating to **beta 03**, calling expand() or collapse() within GlobalScope.launch my application started to crash with the error:
> A MonotonicFrameClock is not available in this CoroutineContext. Callers should supply an appropriate MonotonicFrameClock using withContext.

This happens because `GlobalScope` doesnâ€™t have a `CoroutineContext` associated with it, which is needed for animating the **BottomSheet**. Alternatively, we should use the CoroutineScope:

```kotlin
val coroutineScope = rememberCoroutineScope()

val bottomSheetScaffoldState = rememberBottomSheetScaffoldState(
    bottomSheetState = rememberBottomSheetState(
    initialValue = BottomSheetValue.Collapsed)
)
    
BottomSheetScaffold(
    sheetContent = {
        // The content you want to show in your bottom sheet*
    },
    scaffoldState = bottomSheetScaffoldState) {
        // The content you want to show in your screen*
    }
)
```

And then when you want to `expand()` or `collapse()` the **BottomSheet**, call:

```kotlin
coroutineScope.launch {
    bottomSheetScaffoldState.bottomSheetState.collapse()
}
```

Moreover, using a GlobalScope usually, itâ€™s not the best approach how there:

* The scope of GlobalScope corresponds to the app lifecycle.
* It has no associated Job itâ€™s not possible to cancel this coroutine.
* Building tests for code thatâ€™s using GlobalScope is much trickier.

And well, the official [documentation](https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines/-global-scope/index.html) advise you not to use it:
> Application code usually should use an application-defined [CoroutineScope](https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines/-coroutine-scope/index.html). Using [async](https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines/async.html) or [launch](https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines/launch.html) on the instance of [GlobalScope](https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines/-global-scope/index.html) is highly discouraged.
