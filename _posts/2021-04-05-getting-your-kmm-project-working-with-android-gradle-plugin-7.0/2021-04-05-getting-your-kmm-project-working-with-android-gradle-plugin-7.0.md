# Getting your KMM project working with Android Gradle Plugin 7.0+

Getting‚Ä¶ your KMM project working with AGP 7.0+ (Android Gradle Plugin) cover image

I‚Äôm really enthusiastic about the future of (native) mobile development. In the past years, we‚Äôve been watching a paradigm switch on how we should develop our screens. We no longer need to do them on XML or XIBs, and can finally embrace the potential of declarative UIs. On the Android side, we‚Äôve got Jetpack Compose, and on iOS SwiftUI.

Although still in beta, if you want to take advantage of the latest versions of Jetpack Compose, you‚Äôll need to install the canary version of Android Studio (Canary build), currently, we are with Android Studio Arctic Fox - 2020.3.1 Canary 12.

However, these changes require that you update your Android project to the latest version of AGP (Android Gradle Plugin) ‚Äî at the time of this writing I‚Äôm with **gradle:7.0.0-alpha12**

Of course, all major updates require some other changes along the way. So, let‚Äôs enumerate all the problems that I had and how I‚Äôve solved them.

**Note:** the commands written here were tested on a Mac with Big Sur. If you‚Äôve you‚Äôre using a different Operating System, they may differ.

## Select the right version of Java

Not all the versions are currently supported, so if you have an error similar to this one:
```shell
> Task :common-dto:linkDebugFrameworkIosArm64 FAILED
e: Compilation failed: /Users/carlosmota/.konan/kotlin-native-prebuilt-macos-1.4.31/konan/nativelib/6538169044806663713/libllvmstubs.dylib: dlopen(/Users/carlosmota/.konan/kotlin-native-prebuilt-macos-1.4.31/konan/nativelib/6538169044806663713/libllvmstubs.dylib, 1): no suitable image found. Did find:
```

It‚Äôs time to move to **AdoptOpenJDK 11.0.10**.

### Why 11.0.10?

I‚Äôve tried a couple of versions and this one seemed to be the most recent supported by Gradle, if you try to run for instance OpenJDK14 you‚Äôll get a couple of errors while trying to compile your project.

### How to install?

The easiest way is to install it via brew:

```shell
brew tap AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk
brew install --cask adoptopenjdk11
```

**Note:** You can find all the information on their GitHub [repository](https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/homebrew-openjdk).

### What if you have different Java versions installed?

It‚Äôs possible to have more than one version installed, but only set one as default. Run:

```shell
java -version
```

And confirm that the version that is printed is the one you‚Äôve just installed. Otherwise, you might have compilation errors while trying to build your KMM project.

To see all the Java versions that you‚Äôve got installed, run:

```shell
/usr/libexec/java_home -V
```

In my case, this is my output:

```shell
Matching Java Virtual Machines (3):
16 (x86_64) ‚ÄúOracle Corporation‚Äù ‚Äî ‚ÄúJava SE 16‚Äù /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-16.jdk/Contents/Home
11.0.10 (x86_64) ‚ÄúAdoptOpenJDK‚Äù ‚Äî ‚ÄúAdoptOpenJDK 11‚Äù /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/adoptopenjdk-11.jdk/Contents/Home
1.8.281.09 (x86_64) ‚ÄúOracle Corporation‚Äù ‚Äî ‚ÄúJava‚Äù /Library/Internet Plug-Ins/JavaAppletPlugin.plugin/Contents/Home
```

Since I‚Äôm looking for **AdoptOpenJDK** **11.0.10**, I need to update my **JAVA_HOME** path, for that, I can call directly:

```shell
export JAVA_HOME=`/usr/libexec/java_home -v 11.0.10`
```

Now, if I run the command java -version once again I‚Äôll get the new path:

```shell
openjdk version ‚Äú11.0.10‚Äù 2021‚Äì01‚Äì19
OpenJDK Runtime Environment AdoptOpenJDK (build 11.0.10+9)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM AdoptOpenJDK (build 11.0.10+9, mixed mode)
```

**Note:** using export is just setting the JAVA_HOME for the current run.

## Configuration with name ‚ÄòtestApi‚Äô not found.

If you‚Äôre working on a KMM (Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile) project, when updating to AGP7.0.0 you‚Äôll probably get an error similar to this one:
```shell
Configuration with name 'testApi' not found.
    at org.gradle.api.internal.artifacts.configurations.DefaultConfigurationContainer.createNotFoundException(DefaultConfigurationContainer.java:165)
    at org.gradle.api.internal.DefaultNamedDomainObjectCollection.getByName(DefaultNamedDomainObjectCollection.java:333)
    at org.gradle.api.internal.artifacts.configurations.DefaultConfiguratio¬ßnContainer.getByName(DefaultConfigurationContainer.java:155)
```

This seems to be an issue with Gradle itself and it‚Äôs already reported on [KT-43944](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-43944). Fortunately, the fix is really simple and there are no side effects (at least that we know of). On you **build.gradle.kts** add:

```shell
android {
    configurations {
        create("androidTestApi")
        create("androidTestDebugApi")
        create("androidTestReleaseApi")
        create("testApi")
        create("testDebugApi")
        create("testReleaseApi")
    }
}
```

**Note:** you need to add this configuration before the kotlin {} block. A special thanks to Martin Bonnin for adding the solution to the issue.

## MissingXcodeException

Another that you might find during this update is that although you‚Äôve got Xcode installed and have been using it without any problem in your KMM (Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile) project, suddenly when you decide to make the update you start having:

```shell
MissingXcodeException: An error occurred during an xcrun execution. Make sure that Xcode and its command line tools are properly installed. at org.jetbrains.kotlin.konan.target.CurrentXcode
```

Yes. No idea, how and why this starts to happen, but fortunately the fix is quite direct. Just open Xcode and go to:

```shell
Preferences ‚Üí Locations ‚Üí Command Line Tools
```

Per default it seems that there‚Äôs no option selected, just pick one.

Do you have a better approach? Something didn‚Äôt quite work with you?
