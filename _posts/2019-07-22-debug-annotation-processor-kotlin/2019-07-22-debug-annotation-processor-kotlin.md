I‚Äôve recently revisited a library that I‚Äôve done a while back using annotation processor and as soon as I opened it and started reading the code I‚Äôve remembered how difficult it was to debug it at the time. So, a few years later let's see what changed and how can we use the debugger instead of just adding some log messages.

## Log messages

In order to print messages during compile time of your annotation processor you need to use ProcessingEnvironment.getMessager().printMessage(...) . The ProcessingEnvironment object is defined in the AbstractProcessor class and you can easily access it when you extend it.
```java
class GenerateProcessor : AbstractProcessor() {
    
  override fun process(type: MutableSet<out TypeElement>?, 
                       roundEnv: RoundEnvironment?): Boolean {

  processingEnv.*messager*.printMessage(WARNING, "Processing")
  ...
```
Although this method can receive a couple of arguments, typically we send it just two:
```java
void printMessage(Diagnostic.Kind kind, CharSequence charSequence);
```
`Kind` corresponds to the type of log message (sorted by severity, being the first one the most critical):

**ERROR**  
When something is invalid or it‚Äôs missing. If this type is defined the compilation process is aborted and the error displayed on the console log.  
  
**WARNING**  
When something it‚Äôs not 100% correct but it‚Äôs not enough to stop the compilation process.  

**MANDATORY_WARNING**  
Similar to a warning, but is mandated by the tool‚Äôs specification.  

**NOTE**  
Informative message ‚Äî for instance, when a task starts/ ends.  

**OTHER**  
When the message does not fit in any of the above categories.

## Debug

Similar to attaching the debugger to an application that‚Äôs running on your smartphone or emulator you can do the same thing during the compilation process ‚Äî which is truly incredible and really helpful, trust me.

### How can you do this?

There are a couple of steps involved in this task ‚Äî I‚Äôm currently using Kotlin v1.3.41 and Gradle 5.1.1 (with Android Plugin 3.4.2):

1. We‚Äôre going to first create a **Remote Configuration** so you can attach it later to debug your annotation processor code:
    1. Go to **Edit Configurations‚Ä¶** (Run/ Debug Configurations)
    2. Click on the plus sign (‚Äú+‚Äù)
    3. Select **Remote**
    4. You should have a new configuration added that‚Äôs similar to this one:

    <figure>

    <figcaption>Remote debugger configuration</figcaption>
    </figure>

    I‚Äôve used the default configuration here ‚Äî I‚Äôve just changed the default name to **Debugger** so it will be easier to spot on Android Studio actions bar.

2. On your **gradle.properties** file you‚Äôll need to add:
    ```gradle
kapt.use.worker.api=true
    ```
    otherwise, it won‚Äôt stop on your breakpoints.

3. Now that everything is prepared you can start compiling the app by entering the following command in **Terminal** (I typically use the one in Android Studio):
```shell
./gradlew --no-daemon -Dorg.gradle.debug=true -Dkotlin.daemon.jvm.options="-Xdebug,-Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket\,address=5005\,server=y\,suspend=n" :clean assemble
```
But what does this all mean?

### Gradle daemon
```shell
-Dorg.gradle.debug=true
```
Starts a new Gradle process that will run the build with remote debugging enabled, listening on port 5005 by default. It‚Äôs equivalent to call:
```shell
-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=y,address=5005
```
If you look at the `suspend` attribute you can see that it‚Äôs true, meaning that the virtual machine will be suspended until a debugger is attached.

### Kotlin daemon
```shell
-Dkotlin.daemon.jvm.options="-Xdebug,-Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket\,address=5005\,server=y\,suspend=n"
```
Kotlin starts a daemon process that listens on port 5005 for a debugger

**transport**  
Name of the transport used to connect to the debugger application (required). The default value if not set is `none`.  

**address**  
The transport address for the connection. If `server` option is set to `n` the debugger will attempt to be attached at this address; if instead is enabled - `y` it will listen for a connection at this port (if `server=n` this option is required). The default value if not set is "" (empty).  

**server**  
If `y` it will listen for a debugger to be attached; otherwise, will attach to the debugger application at the specified address (not required). The default value if not set is `n`.  

**suspend**  
It defines the policy used on `VMStartEvent` if `y` it will be `SUSPEND_ALL` otherwise will be `SUSPEND_NONE` (not required). The default value if not set is `y`.  

And the last instructions are responsible to clean and compile the current project.

```shell
:clean assemble
```

After entering the command this process will wait until you attach the debugger ‚Äî this guarantees that you don‚Äôt miss the breakpoint by not being fast enough:

Before, attaching the debugger don‚Äôt forget to check if you‚Äôve got the right configuration selection. Once confirmed, just hit debug.

</figure>


Once the daemon detects that the debugger is attached the compilation process continues until it detects your breakpoint.

## Troubleshooting

I‚Äôve spent some time trying to understand why this wasn‚Äôt working correctly in the first place ‚Äî some useful commands that I‚Äôve been using during this process were:

* jps ‚Äî Java Virtual Machine Process Status Tool

```shell
$ jps
```

To list all JVM‚Äôs that are currently running. Before understanding the right commands to use I kept having <b>Connection Refused</b> errors when I tried to attach the debugger ‚Äî this happened because I‚Äôd left a daemon active that was already bound to the port 5005.

```shell
$ jps
  5541 GradleDaemon
  294 
  5671 Jps
```

You can easily stop it by either call ./gradlew ‚Äî-stop or kill(pid) in this case, it would be kill(5541) .
