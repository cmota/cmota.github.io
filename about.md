Carlos Mota is an Android GDE. He can easily be spotted either working on Android applications written in Kotlin or developing them along with Kotlin Multiplatform. An enthusiastic for new technology and always trying to reach those last 20% of all of his side projects that seem to be really far away. He loves to share his knowledge with others either by giving talks, teaching, writing or along with a cold beer in the nearest pub. GDG Coimbra organizer and Kotlin evangelist, he also has a huge passion for travel, photography, space and the occasional run.
