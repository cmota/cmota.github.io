Like all tales, this one also starts with “once upon a time…”. It tells you the story of the frameworks that have been surging to complete the ultimate quest in the cross-platform world:
* Allow developers to write their code once, and run it on all platforms.

Yes, run it on mobile, web, smartphone, car, fridges, smartwatches, etc.

This is no easy quest, but we’re finally seeing a lot of potential and followers in one of these heroes - Kotlin Multiplatform.

Join me on Speaking about to learn more about Kotlin Multiplatform and how you can start using it on your projects.

Press X to accept the quest.
