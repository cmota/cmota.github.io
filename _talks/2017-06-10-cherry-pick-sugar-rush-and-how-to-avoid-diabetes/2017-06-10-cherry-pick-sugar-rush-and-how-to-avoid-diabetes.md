Every year we get a new treat - donuts, kitkats, Marshmallows, Nougats,... the path is already long. We've dealt with brocken API's that have been forgotten, old implementations that have been redesign and new components that are still lost somewhere on support libraries. On this talk were going to give an overview on what new API's are out there and discuss several lessons learned along the path.

Today I learned: - Oooooooh did you know that on Android O you won't need to cast the returned view from findViewById? - Did you ever needed a TextView that would automatically increase/expand according to the available width? - Do want to implement an horizontal scroll view and don't want to create a new component from scratch?
