Are you an Android developer?

Do you spend most of your time writting layouts and then inflating them?

Do you wish you could go a little further but don't have time or need to do so?

Well, welcome to the Android Autumn Sessions!

In this course we will approach the little and important things that you are unable to do in your day-to-day tasks. In the end, hopefully, some of the knowledge acquired will find a place in your daily work, helping you build better applications with less effort.
