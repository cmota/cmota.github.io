Join me in this adventure through Kotlin and Compose Multiplatform and learn how you can develop apps using these technologies. Youâ€™ve got your Android app already developed? See how you can make it run on your watch and on the Desktop effortlessly. Or how you can share your business logic with iOS and speed up your development. Perhaps, you want to develop for the Web? See how you can give the first steps into Compose for the Web while also sharing your logic.
