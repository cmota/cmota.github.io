Three different platforms meet at a bar and decided to share (pun intended) a couple of drinks.

This last year has been great for multiplatform development. As Kotlin keeps pushing for new releases and KMP starts to gain more adoption and stable releases, we now have the chance to write the UI for our Android apps with Compose and share it along with the Desktop and the Web.

In this talk, youâ€™re going to see how you can start to decompose your Android app and start sharing all of its content along with a Desktop app and the Web. Drink at your own responsibility.
