Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile is one of the trend topics in the cross-platform apps development.

With KMM we can share code between Android and iOS writing the business logic once and then focusing on the platform-specific UIs. Maybe using Compose on Android and SwiftUI on iOS.
- Does it worth it?
- How much code can we really share?
- Will our fellow iOS developers hate us?

In this roundtable weâ€™ll try to answer to these and many other questions.
