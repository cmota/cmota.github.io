Kotlin Multiplatform is here to stay! We start to see several products in production that are already migrating part of their code/ implementing new features with KMP. The goal here is simple, develop your application logic once and use it on every platform.

So join me on the next two hours on this multiplatform adventure and letâ€™s create an app for android and iOS.

Attendees will learn...
- how they can set up both the Android and iOS environment
- how to interact with third-party services, an API for instance
- use the most common kmp libraries like ktor
- share all of this logic across both platforms
