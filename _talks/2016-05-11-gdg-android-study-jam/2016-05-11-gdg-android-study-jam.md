We're hosting a weekly study group for the Udacity Android Fundamentals course (https://www.udacity.com/course/ud853).

This is an introductory course to Android but it's quite dense and the contents come directly from Google Android Engineers (the quality of the content is really good). I think that even if you're a professional Android developer there's something you will learn.

Previous Java knowledge is highly recommended but experience in any other programming language should be enough.
