Compose is here! ðŸ™Œ

I've created a codelab where you can follow step by step the development of android application using Compose:

It's also worth to mention that Compose is getting Multiplatform! If you want to know more about this check a template that I've created - _alicerce_ which uses Kotlin Multiplatform to share the business logic and Compose to share the UI.
